# Mounting Plates and Brackets for CAN Based Toolhead PCBs
Currently the focus of this repo is the SHT-36 by Mellow.  Plates are available that align with the motor orientation of the following extruders: Sherpa Mini, LGX Lite, Sailfin, and Orbiter.  Mini Afterburner should be able to utilize the Sherpa Mini plate.  The brackets for Sailfin and Orbiter will work if mirrored on X, to match mirrored extruders.  These plates are meant to work with mounting posts, like the strain relief on v0.  Mounting post length should be chosen based on the motor you are using.  I'll get a set of printable mounting posts for various motor lengths uploaded shortly.  You can use the ones in the v0 repo if you just can't wait...

It seems as though the output for the stepper can be switched to the other side of the board if the user wanted it so.  The bracket base has clearance for that.
